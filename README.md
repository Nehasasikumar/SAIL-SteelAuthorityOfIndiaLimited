# üöÇ AI/ML-based Decision Support System for Rake Formation Optimization (SAIL)

## üß≠ Overview
This project develops an **AI/ML-based Decision Support System (DSS)** for optimizing **rake formation strategies** in large-scale logistics operations.  
The first implementation focuses on **movements from Bokaro Steel Plant (BSP)** to **CMO stockyards and customer destinations**.

---

## üîç Detailed Problem Statement

### Context
In large-scale logistics operations (e.g., mining, steel, cement, or ports), rake formation is a critical function. A rake is a full train-load of wagons used to transport bulk materials like coal, iron ore, limestone, or finished goods from stockyards/warehouses to consumption centers or customer destinations.

Currently, rake formation in Steel Plants is often based on manual coordination between:
- Material availability at Plants
- Pending customer orders and their delivery priorities
- Availability of empty rakes/wagons
- Loading point capability and utilization
- Operational constraints like siding capacity, route restrictions

This manual or rule-based approach results in:
- Delayed rake formation, leading to missed delivery deadlines
- Underutilized rakes or partial load shipments
- Increased freight and demurrage costs
- Sub-optimal allocation of materials to rakes across multiple stockyards

### Objective
Develop an AI/ML-based decision support system that:
- Dynamically forms optimal rake plans by evaluating material availability, order position, order priority, loading point availability and rake/wagon availability
- Ensures that rakes are fully and efficiently loaded from the most cost-effective stockyards/destination
- Minimizes total logistics cost, including loading, transport and penalty/delay costs, idle freight

### Problem Scope
The system has to:
- Match material availability across stockyards with open customer orders
- Assign available rakes/wagons to the most suitable loading points
- Optimize the composition of each rake based on cost, availability, and destination constraints
- Respect operational constraints such as minimum rakesize, loading point capacity, and siding availability
- Output daily rake formation and dispatch plan with cost and resource efficiency
- Maintain product vs wagon type matrix
- Suggest production based on rail/road order and rail/road loading capabilities as well as inventory at warehouses

### Key Decisions to Optimize
- For which stockyard(s)/destination should materials be sourced for a rake?
- Which orders or destinations should be clubbed together in a rake (multi-destination allowed or not)?
- Which rake(s)/wagons should be assigned to which route/load point?
- How to sequence rake formation and dispatch to meet SLAs and minimize cost?
- Optimize both rail and road order fulfillment

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Problem Context
In large steel logistics, **rake formation** involves grouping wagons and assigning materials from plants or stockyards to customer destinations.  
Currently, this process is **manual**, leading to:
- Delayed dispatches

- Sub-optimal material allocation  

This system automates and optimizes rake formation using **AI/ML models** that consider:
- Material availability  
- Customer order priorities  
- Rake/wagon availability  
- Loading point constraints  
- Route restrictions  

---

## üéØ Objective
Build a **web-based AI/ML DSS** that dynamically:
- Suggests optimal rake formation and dispatch plans  
- Minimizes total logistics costs  
- Improves resource utilization  
- Enhances on-time delivery performance

The system uses mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to optimize rake formations, minimizing:

```
Total Cost = Œ±‚ÇÅ(Loading Cost) + Œ±‚ÇÇ(Transport Cost) + Œ±‚ÇÉ(Penalty/Delay Cost) + Œ±‚ÇÑ(Idle Capacity Cost)
```

Subject to constraints:

- Delivery SLAs and priority weighting
- Loading point capacity and operating hours
